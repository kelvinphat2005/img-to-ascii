# img-to-ascii
Convert an image (has to be named 'input.png') to ascii art, output as a text file named 'out.txt'
Downscale the output by a factor of an integer by changing the factor variable to whatever you want
Run 'downscale.py' to use.
Run 'multicore.py' to use a bad attempt at multprocessing. It has the same output as 'downscale.py'
